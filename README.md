# Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Project

• Solved Eight Puzzle problem by Java using Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced Tile
heuristic search and A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic search respectively.

• Implemented a Nearest Neighbor Classifier by Python using an annealing algorithm, forward
selection algorithm and backward elimination algorithm respectively.

• Improved the classification accuracy for big dataset by integrating annealing algorithm with
backward selection algorithm.
